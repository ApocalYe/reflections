How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It will point out the lines that are different. 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It will allow you to return to previous verion when you find bugs in your new program. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    It's more logical, which means that it's more useful in programming. While it demand a little bit work in creating checkpoints. 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because programs works relying on other files, while documents works comparatively seperately. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Use git log to find the version you want and compare them with git diff. 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can retrieve the good one with git checkout. 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Probably to help me develop my incoming program projects.
